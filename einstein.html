            <p class="who"><strong>A</strong>lbert Einstein is a mathematician, physicist, and science author from German. Was born on March 14, 1879 in Ulm, Württemberg, German and died on April 18, 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey, U.S. A genius son of Hermann Einstein and Pauline Koch who was well known by the world with his relativity theories. Einstein won a Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his photoelectric effect explanation.</p>
            <p class="who2">Einstein always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics and the determination to solve them. He had a strategy of his own and was able to visualize the main stages on the way to his goal. He regarded his major achievements as mere stepping-stones for the next advance.</p>
            <p class="who3">Einstein’s gifts inevitably resulted in his dwelling much in intellectual solitude and, for relaxation, music played an important part in his life. He married Mileva Maric in 1903 and they had a daughter and two sons; their marriage was dissolved in 1919 and in the same year he married his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, who died in 1936.</p>
